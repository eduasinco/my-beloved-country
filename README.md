# MY BELOVED COUNTRY

This app is a simple and humble site where a list of the countries obtained from the https://restcountries.eu/ API is being showed  with its respective country and region filters that can be used dynamically. 

The app is built with a responsive design pattern that allows to reshape the structure of the views when the size of the window changes.

It also contains simple routing and a dark and light mode with local mode state savings.

## Run the project

To run the project just do:

### `npm install`
and
### `npm start`
