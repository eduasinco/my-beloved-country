## MY BELOVED COUNTRY

This app is as simple and precise as it can be. It presents a list of the countries obtained from the https://restcountries.eu/ API and it has a country and region filter that can be used dynamically. 

The app is built with a responsive design pattern that allows to reshape the structure of the views when the size of the window changes.

It also contains simple routing and dark and light mode capabilities.
